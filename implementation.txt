Implementation notes:
- add document archives link to the index
- when a file is saved, edit the post route logic to save a copy before the changes are written to the file.
  - save this file with the exact date/time appended
  - write this file to an archives folder? (if sinatra will allow this)
- list the archived files in the new archive view
