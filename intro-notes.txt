Goal:
  - build a simple file-based content management system

Process:
  - read thru the Requirements

    - think about WHAT the application needs to do in order to satisfy the requirements

    - then, think about HOW the software will accomplish these things and what changes you need to make to it so that it can run

  - once you have a PLAN, start making the changes
    - make a plan first! every time!
    - do not look at the given implementation steps before you have developed your own plan

  - if solution is different from the given solution, be able to explain clearly HOW they are different and whether or not there will be any noticeable difference for the user


  Implementation:
  - add sign in button to index page
  - add view template for /users/signin
  - add form with username and password fields and sign in button to /users/signin page
  - code backend logic to deal with post request in the form
    - username should reappear on redirect if incorrect username or password
  - redirect the user to the homepage
  - display welcome message
  - add "signed in as username" and "sign out" button to index page
  - code backend logic for post request submitted on "sign out" button click
