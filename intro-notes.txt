Goal:
  - build a simple file-based content management system

Process:
  - read thru the Requirements

    - think about WHAT the application needs to do in order to satisfy the requirements

    - then, think about HOW the software will accomplish these things and what changes you need to make to it so that it can run

  - once you have a PLAN, start making the changes
    - make a plan first! every time!
    - do not look at the given implementation steps before you have developed your own plan

  - if solution is different from the given solution, be able to explain clearly HOW they are different and whether or not there will be any noticeable difference for the user


  Implementation:
    - create and store error message in the session if the requested file does not exist
      - perhaps used File.exists? for this
    - redirect the user back to the homepage
    - add some code in our layout.erb or index.erb files that displays the error message and then deletes the message on page reload (if/else statement)
