Goal:
  - build a simple file-based content management system

Process:
  - read thru the Requirements

    - think about WHAT the application needs to do in order to satisfy the requirements

    - then, think about HOW the software will accomplish these things and what changes you need to make to it so that it can run

  - once you have a PLAN, start making the changes
    - make a plan first! every time!
    - do not look at the given implementation steps before you have developed your own plan

  - if solution is different from the given solution, be able to explain clearly HOW they are different and whether or not there will be any noticeable difference for the user


  Implementation:
  - add / create page and route for new document page
  - build new document form on new document page
  - redirect to index page post submit
    - add message that says filename has been created
  - build validation method for form names
    - new documents must have a name
